about: Request Ensemble plugin integration with a specific framework

---

**NB: Before raising a new issue:**

- Can you provide the integration via a PR?
If you can, this would be greatly appreciated!

- If you can't write the integration:
Please search existing issues to see if your framework of choice has already been requested. If so, simply add a üëçto that issue instead of raising a new issue.

**If you can provide any relevant info/documentation that may help expedite the process of integrating, please links to it here.**
Please don't post code in issues, it's horrid. If you can take the time to write decent code, put it in a PR.
